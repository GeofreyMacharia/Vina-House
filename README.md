# Deployment
The web application is already deployed using render. To access it click the link below:
https://vina-homes.onrender.com

### Disclaimer.
The deployed website is slow, as i am using the free version. For better usage kindly load it up on local machine.


The requirements for its functionality are given on "requirement.txt" file. Inaddition kindly use python version 3.11.3, as the predicting models were created using that version.
